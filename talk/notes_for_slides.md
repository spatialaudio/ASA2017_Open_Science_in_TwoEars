## Two!Ears

## Open Science

## Comparison with AMToolbox

## Two!Ears auditory model

The idea is to discuss the complexity of the model and to introduce our
decisions how to split this up into several modules.

The downside of the single modules is that the usability and/or installation of
the whole framework becomes more complicated.

## Software conclusion

A few sub-points to the one listed on the slide:

* Make a workshop on the topic at the beginning
  * Everyone needs to know git
  * Agree on and introduce a forkflow
* Include a software engineer for complex software projects to avoid
  * Extra work for researchers
  * Usability problems of software
  * Untidy, complicated source code

## Software depends on data

## Possible approaches to data management

## Our solution to data management

## Data conclusion
