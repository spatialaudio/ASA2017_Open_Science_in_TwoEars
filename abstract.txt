Two!Ears software and data -- the struggle for reproducible research

Two!Ears was an EU funded binaural auditory modelling project involving nine
different partners. One of the project goals was to apply the reproducible
research paradigm to all its publications. This was a challenging task as the
project involved huge amounts of software, acoustical measurements, and data
from listening tests. On the other hand it was obvious from the status of the
auditory modelling community and the positive experience with the Auditory
Modelling Toolbox that it would have a positive impact and foster progression
afterwards. As there existed no ready solution to achieve this goal at the
beginning of the project, different paths were tested.  Especially the provision
of a solution for storing the data was challenging.  Here, the goal was not only
to provide long time accessibility of the data, but also to provide all partners
with access to public and private data that is under revision control for
developing.  At the end, the project was able to provide most of its software
and data publicly available, but struggled with applying the reproducible
research principle to most of its papers.  This contribution will discuss best
practices for allowing reproducible research for large projects in the acoustic
community and highlights problems that can occur and how to avoid them.
