Open Science in the Two!Ears Project â€“ Experiences and Best Practices

Two!Ears was an EU funded project for binaural auditory modeling with nine
international partners involved. One of the project goals was to follow an Open Science
approach in all stages. This turned out to be a challenging task as the project
involved huge amounts of software, acoustical measurements, and data from
listening tests. On the other hand it was obvious from the positive experience
with the Auditory Modelling Toolbox that an Open Science approach would have a
positive impact and foster progression afterwards. As there existed no ready
solution to achieve this goal at the beginning of the project, different paths
for data management were tested. It was especially challenging to provide
a solution for data storage. Here, the goal was not only the long
term accessibility of the data, but also the revision control of public and 
private data for the development inside the project. In the
end, the project was able to make most of its software and data publicly
available, but struggled to apply the reproducible research principle to
most of its papers. This contribution will discuss best practices to actively
support reproducible research in large-scale projects in the acoustic community,
points out problems and solutions.
