Open Science in the Two!Ears Project â€“ Experiences and Best Practices

Two!Ears was an EU funded binaural auditory modeling project involving nine
international partners. One of the project goals was to follow an Open Science
approach in all stages. This turned out as a challenging task as the project
involved huge amounts of software, acoustical measurements, and data from
listening tests. On the other hand it was obvious from the positive experience
with the Auditory Modelling Toolbox that an Open Science approach would have a
positive impact and foster progression afterwards. As there existed no ready
solution to achieve this goal at the beginning of the project, different paths
for data management were tested.  Especially the provision of a solution for
storing the data was challenging.  Here, the goal was not only to provide long
time accessibility of the data, but also to provide all partners with access to
public and private data that is under revision control for development.  At the
end, the project was able to provide most of its software and data publicly
available, but struggled with applying the reproducible research principle to
most of its papers.  This contribution will discuss best practices to actively
support reproducible research in large-scale projects in the acoustic community,
points out problems and solutions.
