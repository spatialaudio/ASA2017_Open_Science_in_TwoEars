Two!Ears software and data -- the struggle for reproducible research

Two!Ears was an EU funded binaural auditory modelling project involving nine
different partners. One of the project goals was to apply the reproducible
research paradigm to all its publications. This was a challenging task as the
project involved huge amounts of software, acoustical measurements, and data
from listening tests. On the other hand it was obvious from the status of the
auditory modelling community and the positive experience with the Auditory
Modelling Toolbox that it would have a positive impact and foster progression
afterwards. As there existed no ready solution to
achieve this goal at the beginning of the project, different pathes were tested.
Especially the provision of a solution for storing the data was challenging.
Here, the goal was not only to provide long time accessibility of the data, but
also to provide all partners with access to public and private data that is
under revision control for developing was a mayor challenge.
At the end, the project was able to provide all software and data, but struggled
with applying the reproducible research principle to most of its papers.
This contribution will discuss best practices for allowing reproducible research
for large projects in the acoustic community and highlights problems that can
occur and how to avoid them.

For software developing a revision system was needed as well, but with git a
solution was ready that provided all desired features. Here, most partners were
in favor of private repositories hosted on university servers. One of the
problems which this approach was that most of the published papers of Two!Ears
were not able to follow the guidelines of reproducible research as most of them
used some private revision of the software that was never made public together
with the paper. Those problems led to the decision to switch to a public
repositories for the developing of the whole software framework.
